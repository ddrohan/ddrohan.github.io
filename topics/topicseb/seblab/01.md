# Setup Advice

- This is the software we will use for our Multiple Choice Question (MCQ) Exams for your Assessment

- It is **VERY IMPORTANT** that you:
    - take your time and set up Safe Exam Browser (SEB) on your computer **BEFORE** any official MCQ Exams.
    - read the instructions carefully so that you set up SEB correctly for your WINDOWS or MACBOOK Computer.
    - if you have any problems at all and are unable to complete the Sample MCQ Test (at the end of these setup steps) make sure you tell your lecturer and ask him to help you **BEFORE** any official MCQ Exams.

It is a **REQUIREMENT** that you have SEB working correctly **BEFORE** any official MCQ Exams, otherwise you will not be able to sit/attempt the MCQ Exam.
