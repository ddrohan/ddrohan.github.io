# Lab Advice

- Your labs are not a race to be the first student finished.

- It is very important that you:
    - take your time.
    - read the instructions carefully.
    - ask your lecturer to explain concepts that you don't understand; that is what we are here for!


- Where code is given in labs, resist the urge to cut and paste it; maximise your learning by typing the code in.

- The more mistakes you make when working through these labs, the more you learn.  If you reach the end of the lab and you haven't made any mistakes, a good learning exercise would be to try to produce syntax / logic errors and troubleshoot them.
