# Writing your own methods (1)

In this step, you will work on reproducing the code examples **5.2 to 5.5** inclusive from your lectures.


## Example 5.2

Create a new Processing sketch in your workspace and call it **Example\_5\_2**.

Write a method called **`drawRedSquare`** that takes no parameters.  

The return type for this method is **`void`**.

The method body should include the following processing:

- set the fill colour to red.
- draw a square with a length of 60 pixels at the coordinates (70,70).


The **`drawRedSquare`** method should be called from the `draw()` method.

Run your code; a red square should be drawn on the display window.

The solution code is:

~~~java
void setup()
{
  size(200,200);
  background(20,70,105);
}

void draw()
{
   drawRedSquare();
}

void drawRedSquare()
{
  fill(255,0,0);
  rect(70,70,60,60);
}
~~~


## Example 5.3

Create a new Processing sketch in your workspace and call it **Example\_5\_3**.

Write a method called **`drawRedSquare`** that takes one parameter of type **`int`**.  This parameter will be used to set the length of the square.

The return type for this method is **`void`**.

The method body should include the following processing:

- set the fill colour to red.
- draw a square at the coordinates (70,70) and use the int parameter to determine the length of the square.


The **`drawRedSquare`** method should be called from the `draw()` method, passing the value **60** as its argument.

Run your code; a red square should be drawn on the display window.

The solution code is:

~~~java
void setup()
{
  size(200,200);
  background(20,70,105);
}

void draw()
{
   drawRedSquare(60);
}

void drawRedSquare(int length)
{
  fill(255,0,0);
  rect(70,70,length, length);
}
~~~


## Example 5.4

Create a new Processing sketch in your workspace and call it **Example\_5\_4**.

Write a method called **`drawRedSquare`** that takes three parameters.  Each of the parameters is of type **int**:

- parameter one represents the `length` of the square.

- parameter two represents the `xCoordinate` of the square.

- parameter three represents the `yCoordinate` of the square.


The return type for this method is **`void`**.

The method body should include the following processing:

- set the fill colour to red.

- draw a square where:

    - the length of the square is the value passed as the first parameter into the method.
 
    - its coordinates are those that were passed as the second and third arguments to the method. 

    
The **`drawRedSquare`** method should be called from the `draw()` method, passing the values **60, 70, 40** as its arguments.

Run your code; a red square should be drawn on the display window.

The solution code is:

~~~java
void setup()
{
  size(200,200);
  background(20,70,105);
}

void draw()
{
   drawRedSquare(60,70,40);
}

void drawRedSquare(int length, int xCoord, int yCoord)
{
  fill(255,0,0);
  rect(xCoord,yCoord,length, length);
}
~~~


## Example 5.5

Create a new Processing sketch in your workspace and call it **Example\_5\_5**.

Enter the following code into the sketch (don't cut and paste, write it out):

~~~java
void setup() 
{ 
    size(200,200); 
    background(20,70,105); 
}

void draw()
{
    for (int i = 1; i < 7; i++)
    {
        drawRedSquare(25, i*25, i*20);
    }
}

void drawRedSquare(int length, int xCoord, int yCoord)
{
    fill(255,0,0);
    rect(xCoord,yCoord, length, length);
}
~~~

This code calls the `drawRedSquare` method multiple times (using a for loop).  

Run your code.  Does it work as you would expect?  Are 6 red squares drawn on the display window?

Now try re-write the for loop so that it is a while loop.  Run and test your code again.  There should be no changes in the display window.
