# Writing your own methods (2)

In this step, you will work on reproducing the code example **5.6** from your lectures.


## Example 5.6

Create a new Processing sketch in your workspace and call it **Example\_5\_6**.

Enter the following code into the sketchbook (don't cut and paste, write it out):

~~~java
int value = 30;

void setup()
{
    int result = timestwo(value);
    println(result);
}

int timestwo(int val) 
{ 
    val = val * 2; 
    return val; 
}
~~~

This code calls the **`timesTwo`** method from the `setup()` method.  This means that the **`timesTwo`** method is only called once.

The **`timesTwo`** method takes in a parameter of type **`int`**, it multiplies the value of this parameter by 2 and then returns the value back to where the method was called from.  It stores the returned value in another variable of type **`int`** that is called **`result`**.  The value of the variable **`result`** is printed to the console.

Run your code.  Does it work as you would expect?  Is the value 60 printed to the console?
