## Solutions

The solutions for this lab can be found [here](archives/lab02_solutions.zip). 

If you require unzipping software, 7zip is a good choice: <http://www.7-zip.org/> (or Keka for Mac <http://www.kekaosx.com/en/>)

After unzipping the solutions, it might be a good idea to copy the folders to your **sketchbook** folder.  From Processing, you could then use **File**, followed by **Sketchbook** to easily open them.
