## Playing with the System Variables

What would happen to our animation if we swapped the **mouseX** and **mouseY** system variables in the **ellipse** function with each other?  

Make this change (the code change is below, if you need it) and see if you can figure out what is going on.

~~~java
    ellipse(mouseY, mouseX, 100, 100)
~~~

Now, what would happen to our animation if we changed our ellipse function to be this:

~~~java
    ellipse(width, mouseY, 100, 100)
~~~

Make this change and see if you can figure out what is going on.

Save your work again using the naming convention: *labXX_stepYY*, where *XX* is the number of the lab and *YY* is the number of the step.
