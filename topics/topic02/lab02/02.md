## Basic Animation

- We will use the following built-in functions to animate our drawings:
    - **setup()**
    - **draw()**
    
### A note on the **setup()** function

- setup() is called once when the program starts and should not be called again.
- setup() can set the screen size and background colour. 
- There can only be one setup() function for each sketch.

### A note on the **draw()** function

- You should never call the draw() function.
- Processing automatically calls the draw() function straight after the setup() call.
- draw() continuously executes the code contained inside it.
- There can only be one draw() function for each sketch.


### Animating Ellipses

In your PDE, enter the following code:
![Animating Ellipses](./img/03.png)
Using the **File**, **Save as...** menu options, save this sketchbook with the following naming convention:  *labXX_stepYY*, where *XX* is the number of the lab and *YY* is the number of the step.

Run the code.  As you move your mouse around the canvas, you should have animation similar to the screen shot below.
![Animating Ellipses - Multiple Circles](./img/04.png)
Can you explain why there are multiple circles drawn?  Why not just one circle?
