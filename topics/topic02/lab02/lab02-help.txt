STEPS
=====

Step 4:
int only stores whole numbers. It cuts off the decimal
70.56 becomes 70

Step 5:
float xCoordinate = 50; // same as saying 50.00

float to double causes an error because Coordinates are passed into a function expecting floats (32 bit). Doubles are bigger (64 bit) and so it raise an error

you can't have 2 vars declared as the same name

EXERCISES:
==========

Exercise 1:
y1 and y2 are the same for horizontal lines

x1 and x2 are same for vertical lines
to connect with first horizontal line and last horizontal line, the y1 should be same as y from first horizontal line, and the y2 should be same as y from last horizontal line


Exercise 2:
substitute a,b,c with sys vars: width and height

Exercise 3:
circle -> width and height are same.
x is mouseX
y is mouseY

Exercise 4:
	
  // white circle
  fill(255);
  ellipse(x, y, y, y);
  //black circle
  fill(0);
  ellipse(y, x, x, x);
