## ShopV2.2 - Console Menu System

In IntelliJ, create a new project called **ShopV2.2**.

Copy your completed ShopV2.1 java files (Driver, Store and Product) into this new project.  Alternatively, you can use our solution: [ShopV2.1](archives/ShopV2.1.zip).

There will be no changes in the `Product` and `Store` classes.  All the changes below are in the `Driver` class.  We are going to add a menu to our app, so that the user can choose what options they would like to call.  

### Driver class

Add the following new methods to your Driver class:

~~~java
    private int mainMenu(){
        System.out.print("""
               Shop Menu
               ---------
                  1) List the Products
                  2) List the current products
                  3) Display average product unit cost
                  4) Display cheapest product
                  5) List products that are more expensive than a given price
                  0) Exit
               ==>> """);
        int option = input.nextInt();
        return option;
    }
~~~

~~~java
    private void runMenu(){
        int option = mainMenu();

        while (option != 0){

            switch (option){
                case 1 -> printProducts();
                case 2 -> printCurrentProducts();
                case 3 -> printAverageProductPrice();
                case 4 -> printCheapestProduct();
                case 5 -> printProductsAboveAPrice();
                default -> System.out.println("Invalid option entered: " + option);
            }

            //pause the program so that the user can read what we just printed to the terminal window
            System.out.println("\nPress enter key to continue...");
            input.nextLine();
            input.nextLine(); //second read is required - bug in Scanner class; a String read is ignored straight after reading an int.

            //display the main menu again
            option = mainMenu();
        }

        //the user chose option 0, so exit the program
        System.out.println("Exiting...bye");
        System.exit(0);
    }
~~~

The first method `mainMenu` displays the menu to the console and waits for the user to enter their choice (i.e. a number option).  When they enter a number, it is returned from the method.

The second method `runMenu` controls the repeated display of the above menu and processes the actual option selected by the user.  When option 0 is entered, then this method closes down the program.

Now change your `main` method to be this:

~~~java
   public static void main(String[] args) {
        new Driver();
    }
~~~

And add the following constructor:

~~~java
    public Driver() {
        processOrder();
        runMenu();
    }
~~~


### Test the menu

Now that you have the menu code in the Driver class, you are in a position to test it.  

Run the Driver class and enter the details for, say, 3 products.  The menu should now be displayed and should look something like this:

Test each option and make sure that the output is what you expected.  Test an invalid option too (e.g. 9) and then test the exit option (0) last.
