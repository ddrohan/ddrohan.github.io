# Farenheit / Celsius Converter

In this step, you will work on reproducing the code example 6.10 from your lectures.


## Writing the conversion method

Create a new Processing sketch in your workspace and call it **Example\_6\_10**.

Write a method called **`farenheitToCelsius`** that takes one float parameter.

The return type for this method is **`float`**.

The method returns the result of the conversion:  (farenheit - 32.0) * (5.0/9.0)


## Calling the conversion method

The **`farenheitToCelsius`** method should be called from the `draw()` method.

The value retuned from the calculation should be printed to the console.

Test your code by passing the farenheit value of 451.  The celsius value printed should be:  232.77779
